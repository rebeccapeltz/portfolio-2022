## Description
I took a course on web design. The main project was to create an education website.  My topic is accessiblity which is an important part of [Universal Design for Learning](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/).  I tried to follow Accessbility guidelines in buildint this site.  There is a video that walk you throught the website.
