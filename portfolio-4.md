## Description
During Covid we held Virtual Instructor Led Training (VILT) using Zoom.  It's now commonplace to give and take VILT courses.  We recognized at the time that it was a big change for many of our customers.  There is more to training for corporate customers than just knowledge transfer. Many customer students see in person training as a way to network and get to know the othe students in the class.    
I create this Cloudinary Badge application to see if it could help replace the networking aspect of training.  We'd share the web page and ask students to take or share a photo and provide info about their company and position.  
The application uses Cloudinary technology for taking a photo, uploading it to Cloudinary and delivering it in a photo gallery.  In essense it uses all the concepts that we teach in the Cloudinary Fundamentals course.  We found that people did fill it out.    
We also use some Cloudinary technology so that only photos with faces would be accepted for upload.  

## Tools/Technology 
This application is built using HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript and Cloudinary.
