# Project 1 - Cloudinary Transformations


## Description
Cloudinary allows you to manipulate the size of features of your images and video using transformations.  You can use 
transformations to crop, compress, enhance, and add filters to your media.  There are many options and this periodic table representation of transformations is an attempt to organize them.  You can click on a transformation "element" to take you into the documentation to learn more about the transformation.  I categorize mhy work on this as building a teach aid.

## Tools/Technology 
This application is built using React.js.
